  Hey Friends! I hope you're all doing well. I wanted to share an update on my professional
  journey. As a Senior Platform Engineer, I have been fortunate to gain extensive
  experience over the past couple of years, primarily working with Python. However,
  as I strive to broaden my skill set and explore new horizons, I have recently shifted
  my focus towards distributed systems using the GO ecosystem.
Distributed systems play a crucial role in today's technology landscape, enabling
the development of scalable and resilient applications. By diving into the GO programming
language, I aim to leverage its robust concurrency model, efficient networking
capabilities, and rich standard library to design and build distributed systems
that can handle large workloads and deliver optimal performance.
